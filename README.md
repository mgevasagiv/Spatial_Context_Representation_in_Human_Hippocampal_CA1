# spatcon_2
High res fMRI and a virtual spatial task used to study spatial information in hippocampal subfields (also other MTL subregions).
Re-analysis of a freely available dataset
Uses RSA for analyzing recogntion trials in the scanner

Repository details

Current repository contains the code used to generate analyses for the following paper: Human hippocampal subfields carry information about the spatial context of objects in close proximity to boundaries (in prep)

This is a re-analysis of a dataset (see original publication details below) freely shared on -

A different repository (https://github.com/hallez/abcdcon_pub) contains the code used for basic analysis of the raw data, and also includes analysis reported in:
Dimsdale-Zucker, H. R., Ritchey, M., Ekstrom, A. D., Yonelinas, A. P., Ranganath, C. (2017). CA1 and CA3 differentially support spontaneous retrieval of episodic contexts within human hippocampal subfields. bioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/142349
