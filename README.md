Current repository contains the code used to generate analyses for the following paper: 
**Geva-Sagiv M**, Dimsdale-Zucker HR, Williams AB, Ranganath C (2023). Proximity to Boundaries Reveals Spatial Context Representation in Human Hippocampal CA1. (Neuropsychologia, 2023). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2023.108656

We used a virtual reality exploration task paired with high-resolution fMRI to investigate how boundaries are
reflected in the neural activity of the hippocampus and the extended episodic memory network during recollection. Participants
viewed a set of videos, containing items residing in two different spatial contexts (houses). Following the encoding
of items in these spatial contexts, participants were scanned in an fMRI while they recollected items devoid of any
spatial contextual information. In our experimental paradigm, objects encountered in the entry room were both in
proximity to the event boundary (start and end of the virtual tour) and near the boundary of the spatial context
(entry point of the house). Considering the important role of temporal and spatial boundaries, as well as new
behavioral data we report in our manuscript, demonstration that subjects generate a more detailed memory of
these objects, led us to hypothesize the HC would reflect a dedicated code for these entry room items.

A different repository (https://github.com/hallez/abcdcon_pub) contains the code used for preprocessing of the raw data, and also includes analysis reported in:
